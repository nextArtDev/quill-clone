## Optimistic updates
when we type a message and hit enter, we need some time to submit message to db and generate response, in optimistic update it is immediately put into the chat, even though it is not in a database yet, but for the user feedback that is amazing.

## Infinite queries
we only show the last number of messages and when ever the user scroll to the top, we fetch others.
